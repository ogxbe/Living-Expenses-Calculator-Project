Guidelines:

Your task is to write a program that calculates how many hours a grader/TA at CCI needs to work to cover their living expenses.

The program should account for the cost of the following items:

$625 monthly rent for a local apartment

$27 monthly internet service

$250 monthly grocery bill

$150 monthly 'fun' allowance - funds to be used for leisurely activities

The program should perform the following calculations:


Calculate how many hours the student will have to work in a week to afford the monthly expenses listed above.

Calculate how many hours the student will have to work in a week to include an additional savings of $100 per month.

The program should output the following information:


hourly wage which is $10

each monthly item expense

total monthly expenses

how many hours per week the student would have to work to break even (spend the same amount they earn)

how many hours per week the student would have to work to save $100 a month after paying all expenses

You may assume that a month is 4 weeks.
